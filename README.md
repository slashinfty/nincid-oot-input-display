# OoT input display
Ocarina of Time themed input display skin for NintendoSpy, based on the HUD you see in the game. Available both for Nintendo 64 and Gamecube controller.

The gif shows the Gamecube version of the input display. The discolored patches on the green button are due to gif quality and won't show up on the actualy display.


## Usage
Please visit the [Releases](https://github.com/xwmtp/oot-input-display/releases) page to download the latest skin.

Unzip the downloaded folder containing the skin.xml and images and put it in the ```skins``` folder in the directory where ```NintendoSpy.exe``` is located.

Capture the window in OBS by using Window Capture.

## Color settings
I recommend using the input display against a dark background in OBS, since the buttons slowly fade to black on the sides. You can add a ```Color key``` filter to the source to get rid of the black background. Make sure to play a bit with the settings.

The skin shows button inputs by lighting the corresponding buttons up. If you would like the whole display to look a bit brighter/fainter even when buttons aren't pressed, add a ```Color correction``` filter to the source to adjust the brightness or contrast.

## Support
