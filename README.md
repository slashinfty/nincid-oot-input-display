# OoT input display
Ocarina of Time themed input display skin for NintendoSpy, based on the HUD you see in the game. Available both for Nintendo 64 and Gamecube controller.

The gif shows the Gamecube version of the input display. Note that gif has a lower quality, so the actual display looks more crisp than shown here.


## Usage
Please visit the [Releases](https://github.com/xwmtp/oot-input-display/releases) page to download the latest skin.

Unzip the downloaded folder containing the skin.xml and images and put it in the ```skins``` folder in the directory where ```NintendoSpy.exe``` is located.

Capture the window in OBS by using Window Capture.

## Color settings
I recommend using the input display against a dark background in OBS, since the buttons slowly fade to black on the sides. You can add a ```Color key``` filter to the source to get rid of the black background. Make sure to play a bit with the settings. In particular, I recommend a **smoothness** of 45 and keeping the **similarity** at 1.

The skin shows button inputs by lighting the corresponding buttons up. If you would like the whole display to look a bit brighter/fainter even when buttons aren't pressed, add a ```Color correction``` filter to the source to adjust the brightness or contrast.

## Requests
If people are interested in more skin variatons (red b button for the gamecube version of the game style or maybe items on the c-buttons), let me know by making an issue.

## Support
Skin made by me ([xwillmarktheplace](https://twitch.tv/xwillmarktheplace)). If you like the skin and would like to support me, please take a look at my channel:)
